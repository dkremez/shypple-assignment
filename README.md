# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Assignment

Create a 50x50 grid.

Whenever you click on a cell in this grid, 1 is added to all cells in the same row and column.

If a cell was empty, set it to 1. Every change to a cell should cause the cell to briefly light up
yellow.

If at least 5 successive numbers in the cells form a part of a Fibonacci sequence, shortly light
these cells up green and then empty these cells.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
